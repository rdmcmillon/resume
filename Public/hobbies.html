    <h3>My Hobbies</h3> 
        <p>I love the outdoors.  Whether I am hunting, fishing, or riding horses, I am in my "Happy Place".  I use to be okay with just 
            sharing a tent with my hubby, but I have been there-done that and now I enjoy "glamping" where I have my own bed! I grew up in 
            Montana, training horses and enjoying the beautiful country around me, and I have a great appreciation for what God has created.

        <p>I have hobbies indoor as well.  I love a challenge and am always looking for new things to learn to do. I spend most of my time on 
            the computer and have visited enough websites that I recognize good websites from the more challenging websites. I am learning how to 
            crochet and making something from a ball of yarn. My latest hobby is sublimation. I am always on the lookout for new things to sublimate. 
            I love customizing using a personal photo oy adding a name to make a unique gift. Sometimes I can even get my husband to help out and 
            we love working side by side. The whole sublimation process is fascinating and there is a lot to learn. I enjoy being creative - 
            my art teacher would be shocked!
